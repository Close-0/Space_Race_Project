# Space_Race_Project
Space race data science project

The project explores the data scraped from https://nextspaceflight.com/ website that has information about the past and upcoming rocket launches.
The project has most of the graphs plotted with plotly express. Unfortunately these graphs can't be shown on the static github file. I am working on a solution
to get around this issue.
